I've hosted this website on Drupal since 2010. That's almost a decade. Which is like a century in web time scales. But now it is time for a change.

Using Drupal taught me a ton that I will always value including:
* What a content management system is and why they are nice
* What server-side rendering is
* That I don't really like sysadmin-ing very much
* PHP
* How to participate in an open source community

I'm especially grateful for that last item since, a decade later, many of my closest friends come from the Ethereum, rchain, Parity, and Linux communities.

So why am I leaving Drupal?
* It's big and slow
* It requires a fancy server with php and a database
* Security updates happen too often and aren't easy to automate
* It has disincentivized me from keeping this site active

My general plan moving forward will be to programmatically convert the most important parts of the site (photo/blog, running log, "daily" thoughts) to a static site, host it somewhere easy (maybe github pages), and then add secondary content manually. I'm encouraged by [posts like this](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-10-26-export-a-drupal-site-to-gatsby/). The problem is that I don't have a specific timeframe for completing the migration. But hopefully before fall.
