In December 2018 I went to South Korea with Isaac DeFrain (friend, neighbor, CTY colleague, former RChain colleague) to teach a workshop about blockchain and decentralization through the lens of the RChain project. It was quite an experience. I was pretty nervous going into it, but Isaac had the right mindset. He said it would be as cool as we made it. And we made it pretty cool.

There were lots of punches like long road time, barely working projector, bugs all over the place, language barrier, no printed or translated rholang cheatsheets. But we also had lots of successes like creating a great class dynamic, teaching lots of fundamentals, gaining some new rholang devs, doing 151 with the class, and having fun in Seoul on the last night.

The best part was definitely our crew, codenamed tardigrade. (When we form a band we'll be called guitardigrade)
Jonathan -- Organizer -- Founder of Amazon
Jocellin -- Translator -- Top three crypto advocates in Asia, Renowned Cellist
Hard Core -- Videographer -- Runs the top video production studio for the youtube of Korea
Isaac -- Teacher -- Lead Researcher at RChain
Joshy -- Teacher -- Top Rholang Developer
Uncle Tom -- Host -- Known throughout Gimcheon as the "popeye of Korea" for doing 50 pushups in one go
