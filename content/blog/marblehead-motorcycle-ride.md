I went on another motorcycle ride today with a lot of the same people from the Lake Huron trip. This is Ohio bike week and Mike invited me to ride with hid crew any day I wanted this week. I had other plans earlier in the week and the weather was questionable later in the week so I was thinking I wouldn't join this time. But by coincidence I was blogging about the Lake Huron trip last night and it got me in the motorcycle mood so I joined.

I haven't really serviced my bike at all since last fall except to inflate the tires and give it fresh fuel. It is still in mostly good shape and rode well but I did have to push start it almost every time. This was from a combination of partial failures. First, my starter button is broken and you have to use a screwdriver to make the starter move which isn't that hard, but is kind of annoying to do. Second my battery is old and early in the day, it wasn't charged up well enough to start the bike. And finally, the screwdriver I brought to use as a starter got lost (I forgot what pocket it was in). Thanks to Mike for assisting most of the push starts.

I rode to Huron and met up with Mike, Hall I, Diane (finally met her), Hall II, Andrea, Tim, and Stan. We left for our first stop, Winerie, a local winery about 10:45. Just a few miles from home, Mike turned around and said he'd meet us there. I thought it was a bathroom emergency, but it was just forgotten water for lunch. I split a bottle of wine with Hall and Andrea, and it was good.

The next leg took us over the Sandusky Bay bridge. Last time I crossed that one was on the Lake Huron trip and I was both leaking oil and running out of fuel. Today's crossing was much smoother. We stopped next at the Marblehead Lighthouse for sightseeing and a bathroom stop. Then a short ride to East Harbor state park. I remember going there to swim as a kid, but haven't been back in a long time. Mike had a lunch meat sandwich picnic packed for everyone, and I contributed mixed nuts and blueberries that I had in my bag. It was delicious and fun.

The final stop was a bar in the "old Toft's" building. It was one of the weirdest and coolest places I've seen in a while. One end was a bar, the other end was a coffee shop, and in between and outside was filled with weird random stuff like antiques, a floating golf practice green setup for a wedding. Terrariums, lights, and all kinds of weird stuff. Apparently everything is for sale. We hung there a little longer to wait out some light rain and then said our goodbyes. We still rode as a pack for a while, but split up to go to separate homes.

Overall a fun short day trip and the first time I've done anything for bike week.
