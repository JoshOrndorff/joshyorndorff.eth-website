Here is another modern [Creed without autotune](https://youtu.be/yD15lKJXlF0?t=2408).

Couple voice cracks and missed high notes, but it is real music made by real people. I'd rather see this than autotuned "live" shows any day. I consider this redemption.

I hope Scott's voice gets enough rest and he does some vocal range exercises. Take a touring break if necessary.
