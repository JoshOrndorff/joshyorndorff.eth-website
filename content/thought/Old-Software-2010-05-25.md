China is like a time portal for software.  Seriously.  I thought it was crazy that some of the computers at my school still used Windows 98, but today I asked to borrow a teacher's computer to check my email and it had Internet Explorer 5.  IE5!  I could have checked my email more easily by chewing on the loose end of the Ethernet cable!
