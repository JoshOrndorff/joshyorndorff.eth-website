<span style="font-family: monospace;">a:-a.</span>

Discovered this new emoji, which is <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/59408">also a prolog program</a>  over at code golf. The writer described it as: this looks like a smiley, but I am not sure how to call it. The dot looks like saliva, so maybe "vegetative state", or "Infiurated programmer with curly hair"
