I finally realized the 410k scam. It's just another lock-up-your-tokens in exchange for rewards, yield, and delayed taxes scheme. But if the token collapses while you're still locked in... If you learned that putting money away into a 401k for the future is a good responsible thing to do, then I'm sorry, but you learned how to be exit liquidity. Bit-con-eeeeeect!!!! 401kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk!
