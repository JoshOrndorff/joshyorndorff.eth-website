Yesterday at the airport a guy in a camouflage hat with an american flag sat down next to me, got out his laptop, opened up an ascii-armored RSA Private key, which I clearly saw, VNCed into a remote linux desktop over public wifi, and proceeded to search stack overflow for how to articles. Meanwhile, his wife and kids cheered, "go daddy go; crack those keys".

I'm pretty sure that dude is my arch nemesis.
