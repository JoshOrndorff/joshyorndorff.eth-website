In the book alongside night on page 106 it refers to video discs of "The X-Files".

According to wikipedia, the most popular thing by that name is the [1993 television series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files). But the book (according to my print copy and wikipedia) [was written in 1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alongside_Night).

So wtf?

One hypothesis: There was some thing called "The X-Files" in 1979 (maybe related to the series, maybe not) but it was nowhere near as popular as the series and it is now hard to search for.
