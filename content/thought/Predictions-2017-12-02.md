Two predictions about the information age:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ens.domains/">ENS</a> (or a similar decentralized system) will replace DNS (possibly with backward compatibility)</li>
<li>A truck transporting documents for outsourced shredding (eg. <a href="http://www.ironmountain.com/secure-destruction/secure-shredding">Iron Mountain</a>) will be highway-robbed stage-coach style</li>
</ul>
